        "- Try other models! If you find that gpt-4o-mini is insufficient, you can use the smarter gpt-4o.\n",
        "- If you use other models without Structured Output support, you can use Guardrails to [validate their output](https://ddj.nicu.md/ai/python-validation.html).\n",
        "- Cache things! Don't start over if something goes wrong, save the search results, scrapes and LLM outputs and continue where you left off.\n",
        "- You can use Python's [multithreading](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html) to run multiple classifications in parallel, significantly speeding up the process.\n",
        "- LLMs are still dumb and shouldn't be trusted. Manually verify the classifications if you're going to publish the results."
