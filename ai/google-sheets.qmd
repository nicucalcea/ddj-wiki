title: "Using AI in Google Sheets"

There are [several Google Sheets extensions](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/search/AI?host=sheets) that will let you connect to a large language model (LLM), write requests and store the results of those requests.

However, some of those extensions charge extra fees and the way they work is opaque, meaning they could be reading your requests.

I wrote a very simple Google Sheets script that provides most of the same functionality without sending your data or charging a subscription. Follow the instructions in the link below to install it.

Note that you will still need an OpenAI API key, which does have a cost. This key is different from ChatGPT Plus. You don't need the latter to get an API key.

Let's look at an example.

Make a copy of [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OC1NLimTQ2lSLHOl2X6BVHTSJiKtpkPpFj3gabRVNec/copy). Note that this will also copy the associate Apps Script, aka. the code you need to make the LLM magic happen.

Click on `LLM` in the top menu, select `Settings`, paste your OpenAI key and save.

In cell `B2`, copy the following formula:

```scala
=LLM(A2, "Extract the category from the following text. It can be something like crime, environment, education or healthcare. Please respond with just the category.", "gpt-3.5-turbo", 0)
```

Let's break it down.

1. First, we have the `LLM` formula which tells Sheets that we want to use the Apps Script that connects us to OpenAI.
2. Then we're selecting the `A2` cell, or the first cell with data we want to analyse.
3. Next we have the user prompt. This is a set of instructions that help the AI understand our request and respond accordingly. Notice how I included the `Please respond with just the category` sentence. Without it, the AI may respond with something like `The category of the text is "Schools/High School."`, which is more difficult to aggregate.
4. You can optionally specify the model you want to use. We use `gpt-3.5-turbo` by default, but you can change it to `gpt-4` for a more intelligent, but much pricier model.
5. Finally, you specify the model temperature. Since we want precision, rather than creativity, I've set the temperature to `0`.

You can then drag the formula down to repeat the categorisation for each row.

Because Google Sheets tends to recalculate cells at times, it may try to rerun your formula, which means you may incur additional charges. You can select your `LLM` cells, copy (`Ctrl + C`) and paste them as values (`Ctrl + Shift + C`) to overwrite the formulas with static text.

### Exercise

Use the `LLM` formula to detect whether each piece of legislation is about retirement. Make sure the output is either `Yes`, `No` or `Don't know`.
