>
> [Present law]{.underline} prohibits a public school governing

> requires that such policies include:

> \(1\) Behavioral health services shall be provided during school hours

> services are necessary. [Proposed law]{.underline} specifies that such

> \(2\) Such services may be provided during instructional time in

> [Proposed law]{.underline} prohibits a public school governing

> [Proposed law]{.underline} creates a procedure for grievances and

>
> \(1\) Within 30 days of the issuance of a proposed plan, the public

> \(2\) In response, the behavioral health provider may choose to amend

> \(3\) After the parent\'s approval, the public school governing

> \(4\) Within 14 days of receipt of a complaint, DOE is required to
