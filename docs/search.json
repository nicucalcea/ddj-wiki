It’s history is even older than that though: the first edition of the Manchester Guardian had a data journalism article. So don’t focus too much on what you call it.\n\n\n\nData journalism [is] finding – in data – stories that are of interest to the public and presenting them in the most appropriate manner for public use and reuse. — Bahareh Heravi\n\n\nData journalism does not mean you have to limit yourself to data: we do everything else other reporters do, including developing contacts, interviewing sources, sending FOIs, doing field investigations, checking facts, writing, editing, multimedia (when relevant), etc. At the NS, data journalists are usually in charge of their stories from start to end, we’re not just a graphics desk.\nSome people even have their own beats. I have data journalist colleagues who focus on particular beats, like politics, the environment, business, even fine wines (World of Fine Wines).\nData can be hard and complex, you’ll always want to reach out to experts who can explain things for you. Energy consumption map as an example."

We can greatly simplify or even automate those stories, giving us more time to focus on in-depth reporting.\n\nBe more accurate\nThough not without data quality issues and ethical considerations, accuracy is central to data journalism.\n\nUnique angles\nThere are now stories where a data angle is the only or main angle. By using data, journalists can create news instead of covering them.\n\nPersonalise news\nMake readers invested in a story by personalising it to their postcode, age or socio-economic status.\n\nNew audiences\nData journalism is exciting (I hope).

So don’t focus too much on what you call it.\nData journalism does not mean you have to limit yourself to data: we do everything else other reporters do, including developing contacts, interviewing sources, sending FOIs, doing field investigations, checking facts, writing, editing, multimedia (when relevant), etc.\nData can be hard and complex, you’ll always want to reach out to experts who can explain things for you.\nDespite newsrooms struggling and reducing in size, data journalism teams are growing."

We can greatly simplify or even automate those stories, giving us more time to focus on in-depth reporting.\n\n\nBe more accurate\nThough not without data quality issues and ethical considerations, accuracy is central to data journalism.\n\n\nUnique angles\nThere are now stories where a data angle is the only or main angle. By using data, journalists can create news instead of covering them.\n\n\nPersonalise news\nMake readers invested in a story by personalising it to their postcode, age or socio-economic status.\n\n\nNew audiences\nData journalism is exciting (I hope).

    "text": "Where to find papers\n\nSearch engines\nThere are several websites that index all the major journals. That makes it easier to keep track of new publications and to search all academic journals in one place.\n\nGoogle Scholar: The most popular academic search engine.\nLens.org: Shows a few aggregated stats such as most cited authors, journals, etc.\nDimensions.ai: Includes an “Altmetric”, which is a measure of how popular a paper is based on news coverage, blogs, social media, etc. Useful for weeding out obscure papers if you don’t want those.\nArXiv: Repository of open-access papers. Many preprint papers. Included in some of the search engines above.\n\n\n\nData sources\nAdditionally, there are several repositories of data used in academic research. These are usually replication data, meaning you can use them to recreate the findings of the study, but you can also analyse them differently for new angles.\n\nHarvard Dataverse: Includes replication data and code (often Stata or SPSS, sometimes R).\nZenodo: Same as above, fewer datasets.\nICPSR: More academic data.\nHumanitarian Data Exchange: Mainly datasets that get regularly updated by various corporations and non-profit orgs. Heavy humanitarian focus. Also see AidData.\nOasisHUB: Environmental and risk data.\nPapers with Code: What it says on the tin\nEconomic Articles with Data: Economic articles that have provided data and code for replication purposes\n\n\n\nResearch institutions\n\nNBER: Has a “New This Week” customisable newsletter that includes working papers. You can choose a few categories or keywords, or get everything."

    "text": "How to get alerts for new papers\nGoogle Scholar, Lens.org and Dimensions.ai can all send you alerts for particular topics.\nWith most of them, you can also use advanced search queries to tweak your search to only get certain keywords. Google Scholar, for example, uses the same search operators as normal Google, ex. fdi OR “foreign direct investment” -“flexible display interface”.\nOnce you’ve tuned your search, set an email alert and they’ll send you all new papers that match those search terms."

    "text": "How to access the papers\n\nInstitutional access\nIf you know someone who’s a student or lecturer, they might have access to academic resources.\n\n\nAuthors\nAuthors usually retain copyright and have the legal right to distribute their papers, so you’ll often find them on ResearchGate, Scribd or the authors’ websites. You can also email them and they’ll usually send over a copy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/r/Scholar\nThere’s a subreddit where people can request specific papers. Try the other methods and if you can’t get the paper, request it there and someone with access will retrieve it for you."
