You can find some of them on the Journalist’s Toolbox website.\nHowever, there is one important thing to keep in mind. AI tools are machines that generate text (or other forms of media), not facts.\nLet’s look at an example. I asked Claude to tell me Who is Nicu Calcea?.\nClaude seems to be very confident and gives a pretty detailed response. However, every single one of the “key facts” on that list is false. I know, because I am Nicu Calcea, and there is no Romanian politician with the same name.\nIn the context of Large Language Models (LLMs), these falsehoods are called “hallucinations”.\nWhy does this happen?",

    "section": "How AI works",
    "text": "How AI works\nLet’s assume I ask you to guess the next word in this sentence: I'm .... The answer could be hungry, Nicu, confused, or anything else.\nWhat about if we say I haven't eaten since yesteday, I'm .... Then, the answer is likely to be hungry or starving.\nLet’s take yet another example: Dearest friend, I daresay I have not partaken of food in ages. I'm positively.... Based on the style of the sentence, a better fit would be famished.\nWhat we did is we looked at all the words that came before and filled in the most appropriate choice. This is similar to how a Large Language Model (LLM) works.\nYou can see this in action in the OpenAI Playground. Copy the last sentence in the text box, make sure you have the Show probabilities box ticked on and click Submit to let the LLM complete it.\nYou’ll notice the completed words have been highlighted in different colours, and clicking on the highlighted blocks will show you several options and percentages. This indicates the most likely next “token”, or group of letters. In our example, there was a 91.38% chance that the sentence Dearest friend, I daresay I have not partaken of food in ages. I'm positively would be followed by fam, which had a 99.87% change of being followed by ished, and so on.\n\n\n\nThe OpenAI Playground\n\n\nTo keep the responses dynamic, LLMs apply a degree of randomness to choosing the next token. This means that asking the same question multiple times may give you different answers.\nYou can adjust the Temperature slider in the Playground to control that degree of randomness, where a lower number makes the reply more precise and predictable, while the higher one makes it more creative. For journalism, you’ll normally want to set the temperature to 0, as that will return the most likely output, which is likely to be more precise.\nIn essence, this is a more advanced version of the text predictor on your smartphone. That’s why you can’t trust that its output is the truth, though it often is. It is just the statistically most likely word based on the existing text.\nWhile this is less of an issue for some uses, like creative writing or poetry, journalism is about facts. AI tools are still very bad at reporting.",

    "text": "Extracting structruted data\nI’ve alluded to this issue above when we had to instruct the LLM to respond with just the category. Without it, the AI would have responded with something like The category of the text is \"Schools/High School.\", which is more difficult to aggregate.\nBecause many of the models we use are fine-tuned to be chatbots, so they tend to get a little wordy and emulate a human conversation.\nWe’ll try to coerce these models into giving us structured data in exactly the format we want.\nIn the same Google Sheet you made a copy of earlier, go to the food tab.\nIn the B2 cell, copy the following formula:\n=LLM(A2, \"Extract the name from this email. Respond with just the name, nothing else.\", \"gpt-3.5-turbo\", 0)\nDrag the formula down, and repeat the process for the product, email and email_domain columns.\nFor the emotion column, use the following formula:\n=LLM(A2, \"Extract the emotion from this email. Respond with just 'positive' or 'negative', nothing else.\", \"gpt-3.5-turbo\", 0)\nNot drag the formula down and take a look at the results. Notice anything odd?\nIn the last row, the AI has responded with sad instead of negative or positive, which is what we asked for.\nIf you look back at the contents of the tax, you’ll notice that it explicitly instructs the model to overwrite our initial instructions. This is an example of “prompt injection”.\n\nData validation\nTo spot issues like this, we can use a Sheets formula to validate the response. In the emotion_valid column, paste the following formula:\n=IF(ISNUMBER(MATCH(F2, {\"positive\", \"negative\"}, 0)), \"yes\", \"no\")\nThis formula checks if the response if either positive or negative. If it is, it returns yes, otherwise it returns no.\nAs you drag the formula down, you’ll notice that the last row has a no in the emotion_valid column.\nLet’s do something a little more complex. How do we validate that the email is a valid email address?\nMake sure you’ve asked the LLM to extract the email in column D, and paste the following formula in email_valid:\n=IF(REGEXMATCH(D2, \"^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\"), \"yes\", \"no\")\nWhat we used here is a regular expression, which is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. In this case, we’re looking for a pattern that matches a typical email address.\nRegular expressions are not fun to read or write, but they can be very powerful. You can use AI to generate them for you, but that’s a topic for another day.\nLet’s move on to another example. Open the comments tab and type in this formula in the email_address column, then drag it down:\n=LLM(A2, \"Extract a valid email address from this text. Respond with just the email address, nothing else.\")\nDepending on which model you use, you’ll notice that the AI has extracted some email addresses, but then refused to do so for some texts. In my case, it has returned some messages like There is no valid email address in the provided text.\nLet’s check if the extracted emails are valid. Adapt the regular expressions formula from above in the email_valid column.\nBut this only checks if the extracted email is in the right format. It doesn’t check if the email actually exists in the original text.\nFor that, let’s write a new formula in the email_exists column:\n=IF(REGEXMATCH(A2, B2), \"yes\", \"no\")\nThis formula checks if the extracted email address is anywhere in the original text. If it is, it returns yes, otherwise it returns no.\nOnce you drag it down, you’ll notice that even in columns where it has extracted an email address, Sheets can’t find that email in the text. In my case it extracted info@apha.org in row 4, but there is no email address in that bit of text, only a domain name.\nThis again shows how LLMs are simply tools that return statisically likely responses, rather than correct ones, and why it’s important to validate their responses.\n\n\nSummarising text\nIn the articles tab, we have a list of articles in different languages. Let’s say they’re too long, and we don’t speak all the languages. We want to summarise them.\nIn the summary column, paste the following formula:\n=LLM(B2, \"Summarise this article in English.\")\nDrag the formula down and take a look at the results. You’ll notice that all of the summaries are in English, even if the original article was not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nDespite LLMs being quite good at summarising text, they are still prone to halucinations. Double-check the results or don’t use them for critical stuff.",

If you ask an LLM a question it doesn’t know the answer to, it will confidently make up a plausible-sounding answer that is completely wrong.

Models like Claude 3 Opus quickly become unaffordable.\nRate limits: Some platforms impose limits on how many times you can call the API in a given time period (minute, hour, day) and how big the requests can be.\nOther features: Some models offer additional features like better support for various languages, prompt caching, or structured outputs.\n\nWe’ll use OpenAI’s gpt-4o-mini for this classification. One advantage of this particular model is its support for Structured Outputs. This means you can force the response to follow a certain set of rules.\nLet’s define what we want the output to be.\n\nclass Classification(BaseModel):\n    fossil_fuel_link: bool = Field(description = \"Is this a fossil fuel organization?\")\n    explanation: str = Field(description = \"A brief explanation of your decision, in English\")\n    source: str = Field(description = \"A link to the SINGLE most relevant source that supports your classification\")\n\nNow, let’s make the request to OpenAI.

    "text": "What is Data Journalism?\n\nIn its most simple definition, data journalism is the practice of using numbers and trends to tell a story. — Betsy Ladyzhets\n\n\nSome people call it data-driven journalism, computer-assisted reporting or CAR (in the US), precision journalism. It’s history is even older than that though: the first edition of the Manchester Guardian had a data journalism article. So don’t focus too much on what you call it.\n\n\n\nData journalism [is] finding – in data – stories that are of interest to the public and presenting them in the most appropriate manner for public use and reuse. — Bahareh Heravi\n\n\nData journalism does not mean you have to limit yourself to data: we do everything else other reporters do, including developing contacts, interviewing sources, sending FOIs, doing field investigations, checking facts, writing, editing, multimedia (when relevant), etc. At the NS, data journalists are usually in charge of their stories from start to end, we’re not just a graphics desk.\nSome people even have their own beats. I have data journalist colleagues who focus on particular beats, like politics, the environment, business, even fine wines (World of Fine Wines).\nData can be hard and complex, you’ll always want to reach out to experts who can explain things for you. Energy consumption map as an example."
