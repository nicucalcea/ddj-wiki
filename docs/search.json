    "text": "Trying to make AI lie less\nLarge Language Models are prone to hallucinations. If you ask an LLM a question it doesn’t know the answer to, it will confidently make up a plausible-sounding answer that is completely wrong. This is particularly the case with lesser known organisations or individuals that wouldn’t feature promionently in the training data.\nOne way to minimise (but not completely eliminate) hallucinations is by “grounding” the LLM with some factual data like documents or databases. This is sometimes a technique called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).\nIn our case, we want to allow out agent to search the internet to look for additional information about each donor.\nWe could try scraping search results from Google like we did with the FEC data, but Google doesn’t like that, and they will put various roadblocks in your way such as CAPTCHAs, rate limits or even blocking your IP address. Instead, they want you to use their Custom Search API, which is paid and limited to 10k queries per day.\nOther search engines like Brave provide generous free tiers and more reasonable pricing, and there are some services that specifically cater to AI applications, like Tavily and Perplexity.\nWe’ll use the DuckDuckGo API since it’s free (but rate-limited), doesn’t require signing up for an API key, and comes included with the agents framework we’ll be using.\nWe also want to give our AI the ability to visit each of those search results and extract the text from there. We’ll use a library called Trafilatura since it extract the main text without headers, footers and other irrelevant bits that we probably don’t need for the classification.\n\ndef extract_text(urls: List[str]) -&gt; List[Tuple[str, str]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Extract text content from a list of URLs.\n    \n    Args:\n        urls: A list of URLs to scrape\n        \n    Returns:\n        A list of tuples containing (url, extracted_text)\n    \"\"\"\n    results = []\n\n    for url in urls:\n        # print(f\"Scraping {url}...\")\n        try:\n            response = requests.get(url, timeout=30, verify=False)\n            response.raise_for_status()\n            extracted_text = extract(response.text, output_format=\"markdown\")\n            results.append((url, extracted_text))\n        except requests.RequestException as e:\n            # print(f\"Error scraping {url}: {str(e)}\")\n            results.append((url, f\"Error: {str(e)}\"))\n\n    return results\n\nWe’ll eventually give our agent access to both the duckduckgo search function, as well as the extract_text function that we just created.",

An earlier version of this project used this approach, and it worked well enough.\nSince then, AI agents have become a lot more prominent. Agents are systems in which LLMs are allowed to choose their own steps, use tools appropriate for different tasks and make decisions about when to stop.\nThe code required to create an agent from scratch is fairly simple, but there are several frameworks which come with batteries included.

He is the chairman, president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Stephens Inc., a privately held investment bank.[1]\\n\\nOn December 2, 2024, President-elect Trump announced his nomination of Stephens to serve as the ambassador to the United Kingdom.[2] The U.S. Senate confirmed his nomination in a 59–39 vote.[3] He was sworn in on April 30, 2025.[ citation needed]\\n\\n## Early life and education\\n\\n[edit]Stephens was born in Little Rock, the son of Jackson T. Stephens and Mary Amerine Stephens. Warren\\'s father, \"Jack\" Stephens, and his uncle, \"Witt\" Stephens, partnered as investors and financiers in the investment firm, Stephens Inc.[4]\\n\\nWarren began his education in Little Rock, and in 1975, graduated from Trinity Presbyterian High School in Montgomery, Alabama. He graduated from Washington and Lee University in 1979 with a BA in economics, and received his MBA from Wake Forest University in 1981.[5]\\n\\n## Career\\n\\n[edit]Stephens joined his father and uncle in the investment banking business in Little Rock, which had 139 employees. At that time, the firm resembled and operated much like one of the old British merchant banks, investing the firm\\'s and family funds in various businesses and ventures, and it still operates the same way today. Stephens Inc is noted for handling the IPO of Wal-Mart Stores in 1970.[4]\\n\\nStephens began work as an associate in the corporate finance department, concentrating on oil and gas. He became head of the department in 1983 and spent a lot of time on mergers and acquisitions. On February 18, 1986, Stephens was appointed president and CEO of Stephens Inc.[4]\\n\\nIn 1990, he was the senior advisor to Tyson Foods in their acquisition of Holly Farms in a nine-month takeover battle.[4] He is only the third chairman, president and CEO in the firm\\'s more than 90 years of operations since 1933.[6]\\n\\nIn 2006, Stephens acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Stephens Inc from the other family members.[4]\\n\\nStephens is on the board of Dillard\\'s.[7]\\n\\nIn January 2025, Warren Stephens revealed his decision to step down from his role as CEO of Stephens Inc., as he gets ready to take on the position of U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom. His sons, Miles and John Stephens, have been named co-CEOs, representing the third generation of family leadership at the firm.[8]\\n\\n## Political involvement\\n\\n[edit]A Republican, he supported Bob Dole in 1996, Steve Forbes in 1999, and has supported Mike Huckabee.[9] Stephens was a bundler for Mitt Romney in 2012.[10] He has been critical of presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.[11][12][9] During the 2016 election, Stephens and his brother Jackson Stephens were major financial supporters of the Stop Trump movement.[13]\\n\\nDuring the 2020 presidential election, Stephens donated more than $3 million to Super PACs supporting Trump. In the 2024 Republican presidential primaries, Stephens was a major financial backer of Asa Hutchinson and Nikki Haley.[14][15] During the 2024 presidential campaign, Stephens also contributed to MAGA Inc., a Super PAC aligned with Donald Trump.[16]\\n\\nOn December 2, 2024, President-elect Donald Trump announced Stephens as the nominee to serve as the United States ambassador to the United Kingdom.[17] On February 12, 2025, his nomination was sent to the Senate.[18] His nomination was confirmed by a vote of 59–39 on April 29, 2025.[3] He is awaiting the presentation of his credentials.\\n\\n## Philanthropy\\n\\n[edit]Stephens was on the board of trustees of his alma mater, Washington and Lee University.[5] Stephens and his wife Harriet are benefactors of various organizations, most notably the Episcopal Collegiate School and the Arkansas Arts Center, both in Little Rock.[19][20]\\n\\n## References\\n\\n[edit]**^**\"Warren Stephens\".*Stephens*.**^**\"Trump picks investment banker Warren Stephens as UK ambassador\".*BBC News*.

    "text": "Next steps\nThe example above shows a minimal working example of how to use LLMs to research a dataset. However, there are several ways in which this process could be improved. Here are some ideas:\n\nPlay with the prompt. We asked a simple question, but the more specific you are, the better the results. Write a good prompt, include examples and iterate.\nMake the AI reason. Allowing an LLM to “reason” about its next steps can help it produce better outputs.\nUse different search engines. DuckDuckGo is free and good for a prototype. However, their API isn’t meant to be used this way and will often return errors, especially when used on bigger datasets. It also doesn’t return the best results. I recomment switching to Google, potentially via a SERP API.\nTry other models. I like to use gpt-4.1-mini because it is reasonably fast, cheap and “smart” enough for most tasks. If you find it often gets it wrong, you can use the smarter gpt-4.1 or a “reasoning” model like o3.\nValidate the output. While we did code the classifier to return structured output, you can go beyond that and validate the output (ie. check that the sources are valid URLs, check that the explanation includes exact quotes from the sources, etc).\nSave your progress. Things can and will go wrong! The search engine may fail, the LLM may be down (Claude often is), your Python script may throw an unexpected error. If you don’t want to lose progress, you should save your progress to file or a database so you can pick up from where you left off.\nAsync/Multithreading. In my tests, each classification takes about 20-50 seconds, but it can take longer if the LLM is trying to accesss an unresponsive website. If you have a lot of rows to classify, you should consider running multiple agents in parallel.\nVerify. LLMs are still dumb and shouldn’t be trusted! Manually verify the classifications if you’re going to publish the results.",

Follow the instructions in the link below to install it.\nNote that you will still need an OpenAI API key, which does have a cost. This key is different from ChatGPT Plus. You don’t need the latter to get an API key.\nLet’s look at an example.\nMake a copy of this Google Sheet. Note that this will also copy the associate Apps Script, aka. the code you need to make the LLM magic happen.\nClick on LLM in the top menu, select Settings, paste your OpenAI key and save.\nIn cell B2, copy the following formula:\nLet’s break it down.\nYou can then drag the formula down to repeat the categorisation for each row.",

    "text": "Extracting structruted data\nI’ve alluded to this issue above when we had to instruct the LLM to respond with just the category. Without it, the AI would have responded with something like The category of the text is \"Schools/High School.\", which is more difficult to aggregate.\nBecause many of the models we use are fine-tuned to be chatbots, so they tend to get a little wordy and emulate a human conversation.\nWe’ll try to coerce these models into giving us structured data in exactly the format we want.\nIn the same Google Sheet you made a copy of earlier, go to the food tab.\nIn the B2 cell, copy the following formula:\n=LLM(A2, \"Extract the name from this email. Respond with just the name, nothing else.\", \"gpt-3.5-turbo\", 0)\nDrag the formula down, and repeat the process for the product, email and email_domain columns.\nFor the emotion column, use the following formula:\n=LLM(A2, \"Extract the emotion from this email. Respond with just 'positive' or 'negative', nothing else.\", \"gpt-3.5-turbo\", 0)\nNot drag the formula down and take a look at the results. Notice anything odd?\nIn the last row, the AI has responded with sad instead of negative or positive, which is what we asked for.\nIf you look back at the contents of the tax, you’ll notice that it explicitly instructs the model to overwrite our initial instructions. This is an example of “prompt injection”.\n\nData validation\nTo spot issues like this, we can use a Sheets formula to validate the response. In the emotion_valid column, paste the following formula:\n=IF(ISNUMBER(MATCH(F2, {\"positive\", \"negative\"}, 0)), \"yes\", \"no\")\nThis formula checks if the response if either positive or negative. If it is, it returns yes, otherwise it returns no.\nAs you drag the formula down, you’ll notice that the last row has a no in the emotion_valid column.\nLet’s do something a little more complex. How do we validate that the email is a valid email address?\nMake sure you’ve asked the LLM to extract the email in column D, and paste the following formula in email_valid:\n=IF(REGEXMATCH(D2, \"^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\"), \"yes\", \"no\")\nWhat we used here is a regular expression, which is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. In this case, we’re looking for a pattern that matches a typical email address.\nRegular expressions are not fun to read or write, but they can be very powerful. You can use AI to generate them for you, but that’s a topic for another day.\nLet’s move on to another example. Open the comments tab and type in this formula in the email_address column, then drag it down:\n=LLM(A2, \"Extract a valid email address from this text. Respond with just the email address, nothing else.\")\nDepending on which model you use, you’ll notice that the AI has extracted some email addresses, but then refused to do so for some texts. In my case, it has returned some messages like There is no valid email address in the provided text.\nLet’s check if the extracted emails are valid. Adapt the regular expressions formula from above in the email_valid column.\nBut this only checks if the extracted email is in the right format. It doesn’t check if the email actually exists in the original text.\nFor that, let’s write a new formula in the email_exists column:\n=IF(REGEXMATCH(A2, B2), \"yes\", \"no\")\nThis formula checks if the extracted email address is anywhere in the original text. If it is, it returns yes, otherwise it returns no.\nOnce you drag it down, you’ll notice that even in columns where it has extracted an email address, Sheets can’t find that email in the text. In my case it extracted info@apha.org in row 4, but there is no email address in that bit of text, only a domain name.\nThis again shows how LLMs are simply tools that return statisically likely responses, rather than correct ones, and why it’s important to validate their responses.\n\n\nSummarising text\nIn the articles tab, we have a list of articles in different languages. Let’s say they’re too long, and we don’t speak all the languages. We want to summarise them.\nIn the summary column, paste the following formula:\n=LLM(B2, \"Summarise this article in English.\")\nDrag the formula down and take a look at the results. You’ll notice that all of the summaries are in English, even if the original article was not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nDespite LLMs being quite good at summarising text, they are still prone to halucinations. Double-check the results or don’t use them for critical stuff.",

You can find some of them on the Journalist’s Toolbox website.\nHowever, there is one important thing to keep in mind. AI tools are machines that generate text (or other forms of media), not facts.\nLet’s look at an example. I asked Claude to tell me Who is Nicu Calcea?.\nClaude seems to be very confident and gives a pretty detailed response. However, every single one of the “key facts” on that list is false. I know, because I am Nicu Calcea, and there is no Romanian politician with the same name.\nIn the context of Large Language Models (LLMs), these falsehoods are called “hallucinations”.\nWhy does this happen?",

    "section": "How AI works",
    "text": "How AI works\nLet’s assume I ask you to guess the next word in this sentence: I'm .... The answer could be hungry, Nicu, confused, or anything else.\nWhat about if we say I haven't eaten since yesteday, I'm .... Then, the answer is likely to be hungry or starving.\nLet’s take yet another example: Dearest friend, I daresay I have not partaken of food in ages. I'm positively.... Based on the style of the sentence, a better fit would be famished.\nWhat we did is we looked at all the words that came before and filled in the most appropriate choice. This is similar to how a Large Language Model (LLM) works.\nYou can see this in action in the OpenAI Playground. Copy the last sentence in the text box, make sure you have the Show probabilities box ticked on and click Submit to let the LLM complete it.\nYou’ll notice the completed words have been highlighted in different colours, and clicking on the highlighted blocks will show you several options and percentages. This indicates the most likely next “token”, or group of letters. In our example, there was a 91.38% chance that the sentence Dearest friend, I daresay I have not partaken of food in ages. I'm positively would be followed by fam, which had a 99.87% change of being followed by ished, and so on.\n\n\n\nThe OpenAI Playground\n\n\nTo keep the responses dynamic, LLMs apply a degree of randomness to choosing the next token. This means that asking the same question multiple times may give you different answers.\nYou can adjust the Temperature slider in the Playground to control that degree of randomness, where a lower number makes the reply more precise and predictable, while the higher one makes it more creative. For journalism, you’ll normally want to set the temperature to 0, as that will return the most likely output, which is likely to be more precise.\nIn essence, this is a more advanced version of the text predictor on your smartphone. That’s why you can’t trust that its output is the truth, though it often is. It is just the statistically most likely word based on the existing text.\nWhile this is less of an issue for some uses, like creative writing or poetry, journalism is about facts. AI tools are still very bad at reporting.",
