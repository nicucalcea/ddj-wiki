So don’t focus too much on what you call it.\nData journalism does not mean you have to limit yourself to data: we do everything else other reporters do, including developing contacts, interviewing sources, sending FOIs, doing field investigations, checking facts, writing, editing, multimedia (when relevant), etc. At the NS, data journalists are usually in charge of their stories from start to end, we’re not just a graphics desk.\nSome people even have their own beats.

    "text": "Why do we need data journalism?\n\nTell richer stories\nAn increasing amount of human activity is recorded with data. This means there is a data angle for almost any subject.\n\n\nBe more efficient\nWe tell some stories every year, month or day. We can greatly simplify or even automate those stories, giving us more time to focus on in-depth reporting.\n\n\nBe more accurate\nThough not without data quality issues and ethical considerations, accuracy is central to data journalism.\n\n\nUnique angles\nThere are now stories where a data angle is the only or main angle. By using data, journalists can create news instead of covering them.\n\n\nPersonalise news\nMake readers invested in a story by personalising it to their postcode, age or socio-economic status.\n\n\nNew audiences\nData journalism is exciting (I hope). The pandemic has shown that readers like clear, beautiful data stories and will reward publishers with their clicks."
