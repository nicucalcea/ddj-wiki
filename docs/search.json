It’s history is even older than that though: the first edition of the Manchester Guardian had a data journalism article. So don’t focus too much on what you call it.\n\n\n\nData journalism [is] finding – in data – stories that are of interest to the public and presenting them in the most appropriate manner for public use and reuse. — Bahareh Heravi\n\n\nData journalism does not mean you have to limit yourself to data: we do everything else other reporters do, including developing contacts, interviewing sources, sending FOIs, doing field investigations, checking facts, writing, editing, multimedia (when relevant), etc. At the NS, data journalists are usually in charge of their stories from start to end, we’re not just a graphics desk.\nSome people even have their own beats. I have data journalist colleagues who focus on particular beats, like politics, the environment, business, even fine wines (World of Fine Wines).\nData can be hard and complex, you’ll always want to reach out to experts who can explain things for you. Energy consumption map as an example."

By using data, journalists can create news instead of covering them.\n\nPersonalise news\nMake readers invested in a story by personalising it to their postcode, age or socio-economic status.\n\nNew audiences\nData journalism is exciting (I hope).

It can be called data-driven journalism, computer-assisted reporting or CAR (in the US), precision journalism. Its history is even older than that though: the first edition of the Manchester Guardian had a data journalism article. So don’t focus too much on what you call it.\nData journalism does not mean you have to limit yourself to data: we do everything else other reporters do, including developing contacts, interviewing sources, sending FOIs, doing field investigations, checking facts, writing, editing, multimedia (when relevant), etc.\nData can be hard and complex, you’ll always want to reach out to experts who can explain things for you.\nDespite newsrooms struggling and reducing in size, data journalism teams are growing."

Some data teams, like the one at the FT and the BBC, are now so big they need to be split into two or more teams.\nNew(-ish) platforms like Datawrapper and Flourish allow journalists to create and visualise data stories easier and without much technical expertise.\nHowever, the increased supply of data journalists from courses like this means there are higher entry requirements (R, Python, SQL)."

This means there is a data angle for almost any subject.\n\n\nBe more efficient\nWe tell some stories every year, month or day. We can greatly simplify or even automate those stories, giving us more time to focus on in-depth reporting.\n\n\nBe more accurate\nThough not without data quality issues and ethical considerations, accuracy is central to data journalism.\n\n\nUnique angles\nThere are now stories where a data angle is the only or main angle. By using data, journalists can create news instead of covering them.\n\n\nPersonalise news\nMake readers invested in a story by personalising it to their postcode, age or socio-economic status.\n\n\nNew audiences\nData journalism is exciting (I hope). The pandemic has shown that readers like clear, beautiful data stories and will reward publishers with their clicks."
