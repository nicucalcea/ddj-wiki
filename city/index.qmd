## Who am I?

My name is **Nicu Calcea**.

I'm a **data investigative journalist** and City University alumnus.

I work at **[Global Witness](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/)**, and I was previously doing data journalism at **BBC News** and the **New Statesman**.

# Week 1

Introduction to **Data Journalism**

## What is Data Journalism?

> In its most simple definition, data journalism is the practice of using numbers and trends to tell a story. --- **Betsy Ladyzhets**

::: notes
Some people call it data-driven journalism, computer-assisted reporting or CAR (in the US), precision journalism. It's history is even older than that though: the first edition of the Manchester Guardian had a data journalism article. So don't focus too much on what you call it.
:::

. . .

> Data journalism \[is\] finding -- in data -- stories that are of interest to the public and presenting them in the most appropriate manner for public use and reuse. --- **Bahareh Heravi**

::: notes
Data journalism does not mean you have to limit yourself to data: we do everything else other reporters do, including developing contacts, interviewing sources, sending FOIs, doing field investigations, checking facts, writing, editing, multimedia (when relevant), etc. At the NS, data journalists are usually in charge of their stories from start to end, we're not just a graphics desk.

Some people even have their own beats. I have data journalist colleagues who focus on particular beats, like politics, the environment, business, even fine wines (World of Fine Wines).

Data can be hard and complex, you'll always want to reach out to experts who can explain things for you. Energy consumption map as an example.
:::

## History

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-timeline" data-src="visualisation/14307302?1293534"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
```

## Why do we need data journalism? {.title-slide}

## {#why-we-need-ddj data-menu-title="Why we need data journalism" .smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="33.33%"}
##### Tell richer stories
An increasing amount of human activity is recorded with data. This means there is a data angle for almost any subject.
:::

::: {.column width="33.33%"}
##### Be more efficient
We tell some stories every year, month or day. We can greatly simplify or automate stories, giving us more time to focus on in-depth reporting.
:::

::: {.column width="33.33%"}
##### Be more accurate
Though not without data quality issues and ethical considerations, accuracy is central to data journalism.
:::

::: {.column width="33.33%"}
##### Unique angles
There are now stories where a data angle is the only or main angle. By using data, journalists can create news instead of covering them.
:::

::: {.column width="33.33%"}
##### Personalise news
Make readers invested in a story by personalising it to their postcode, age or socio-economic status.
:::

::: {.column width="33.33%"}
##### New audiences
Data journalism is exciting (I hope). The pandemic has shown that readers will reward publishers with their clicks.
:::
:::


## Job trends {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="33.33%"}
Since the pandemic, nearly every newsrooms has prioritised data journalism and has been massively hiring for data journalism positions.
:::

::: {.column width="33.33%"}
New(-ish) platforms like **Datawrapper** and **Flourish** allow journalists to create and visualise data stories easier and without much technical expertise.
:::

::: {.column width="33.33%"}
However, the increased supply of data journalists from courses like this means there are higher entry requirements (**R**, **Python**, **SQL**).
:::
:::

::: notes
Data teams like the one at the FT and the BBC are now so big they need to be split into several smaller teams.

There are R, Python and SQL courses on Datacamp, which you have access to for free.
:::

## The process

::: columns
::: {.column width="33.33%"}
:::  {.fragment}
##### Question
As with all journalism, data journalism starts with a question that the reporter wants to answer.
:::
:::

::: {.column width="33.33%"}
:::  {.fragment}
##### Source data
Data can come from government sources, third parties, or be collected by the reporter themselves.
:::
:::

::: {.column width="33.33%"}
:::  {.fragment}
##### Clean data
In most cases, you will need to filter, sort and clean up any errors or missing information in your dataset.
:::
:::
:::

## The process

::: columns
::: {.column width="33.33%"}
##### Analyse data
How do you find the answer to your question in the data?
:::

::: {.column width="33.33%"}
:::  {.fragment}
##### Review
While data doesn't lie, data publishers do. Do your findings make sense? Can you verify them?
:::
:::

::: {.column width="33.33%"}
:::  {.fragment}
##### Present results
Communicate data in the most suitable way. Usually, but not always, you will visualise your findings.
:::
:::
:::

::: notes
Analyse data: be platform agnostic. Some tools die because APIs change, others are abandoned by their developers, some are replaced by better alternatives.
:::

::: notes
Show the original dataset first

Some datasets (like the ONS one) come with a data dictionary.

For Nicu: choose boys or girls based on if there are more women or men in the group

Summarising data, like we did in previous lessons, is not always enough to reveal pattern or trends.

Visualising it can provide insight we'd otherwise lose out on.

## Colour scales {background-color="white"}

![](https://blog.datawrapper.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/200801_colorscale-intro-f-1.png)

::: notes
Sequential: Colours (of the same hue) that go from light to dark or the other way around. Usually, darker means higher value.

Diverging: Similar to sequential, but they have a light middle colour that turns darker on both ends of the scale. Useful when you have both positive and negative values.

Categorical: For values that aren't on a numeric scale or don't have an intrinsic order. Useful when none of the colours are more important than others.

> Information visualisation is meant to clarify data, but too much interactivity hinders understanding by transferring responsibility from the designer to the reader to work out the important points. --- **[Martin Stabe (FT)](https://www.ft.com/content/c62b21c6-7feb-11e6-8e50-8ec15fb462f4)**

## Data can be stuck behind inaccessible formats {.smaller}

::: {.column width="33.33%"}
### PDFs

Many organisations still publish data in PDFs, a proprietary format that is difficult to work with. Sometimes, they even do it on purpose.
:::

::: {.column width="33.33%"}
### Images

If you can't find the data behind a chart, ask the author. If you can't do that either, read it from the image.

::: {.column width="33.33%"}
### Websites

If you've got structured information on your page, you'll most likely be able to download in a format that you can analyse.

![](media/survey-qr.png){.absolute height="500"}

::: notes
Notes for staff:

We recommend that you use this slide in class and when module evaluation surveys for your module are open. This is usually in week 9 of the term for ‘standard' modules but if you are unsure your School contact will know (see Section 4 of the Guidance document - https://staffhub.city.ac.uk/academic-services/policies-and-guidance/quality-manual/student-voice)

Once a survey opens, students will receive an email containing a link to the individual module survey. This email will also include a link to the Student Survey Portal (linked to on this slide) which is a static link to show students all open surveys. Individual module survey links will take students directly to the survey. To access the Student Survey Portal students will need to sign in using their University credentials.

Students will receive feedback on their responses but we do need a sufficient number of students to submit a response to enable us to do this. See the Guidance document and Module Leader FAQs for more on feedback https://staffhub.city.ac.uk/academic-services/policies-and-guidance/quality-manual/student-voice
