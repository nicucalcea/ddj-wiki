We are a small group here, so please unmute yourself if you have any questions. That being said, as we will be going through spreadsheets and stuff like that, some options will be different depending on what software you use (Excel vs Google Sheets), the operating system you use, the language your software is in. I will do my best to help but you might have to email me after the module for more help. I would also appreciate if at least some of you will have their cameras on so I don’t feel like I’m talking to a wall. This is recorded and will be posted on Moodle.


---#2
My name is Nicu. This is the first time I’m doing this course, so please have patience. I graduated two years ago and did this module 3 years ago. You can email me with any questions about these slides, examples I’ve given, assignments, etc. I do have a full time job, so for any administrative or urgent queries, please contact Glyn.


---#3
Sorry if I mispronounce all of your names and also sorry if I don’t remember everyone’s name. I will do my best. I understand we are at different levels of experience. You have access to datacamp which will let you move ahead if you want to get a bit more from this module.

---#5
Some people call it data-driven journalism, computer-assisted reporting or CAR (in the US), precision journalism. It’s history is even older than that though: the first edition of the Manchester Guardian had a data journalism article. So don’t focus too much on what you call it.


---#6
Data journalism does not mean you have to limit yourself to data: we do everything else other reporters do, including developing contacts, interviewing sources, sending FOIs, doing field investigations, checking facts, writing, editing, multimedia (when relevant), etc. At the NS, data journalists are usually in charge of their stories from start to end, we’re not just a graphics desk. Some people even have their own beats. I have data journalist colleagues who focus on particular beats, like politics, the environment, business, even fine wines (World of Fine Wines). Data can be hard and complex, you’ll always want to reach out to experts who can explain things for you. Energy consumption map as an example.


---#7
Despite newsrooms struggling and reducing in size, data journalism teams are growing. I was the second data journalist employed at the NS/GD, now there are 14 of us (including two developers) and we’re constantly hiring more people.


---#8
Data teams like the one at the FT and the BBC are now so big they need to be split into two teams. There are R, Python and SQL courses on Datacamp , which you have access to for free.


---#9
Tell richer stories: example Be more efficient: how we use automated journalism at GlobalData ; reuters country pages for covid Be more accurate: You don’t have to rely on anecdotal evidence. Instead, you have thousands, sometimes millions of records that merge to tell a story, shows patterns (or lack of them). Evidence based journalism. Unique angles: Ben van der Merwe’s story on years lost which was exclusive and covered by other outlets Personalise story: Reach Plc and others create postcode lookup tools that show how climate change will affect your area New audiences: as I mentioned, WaPo’s most visited story is a data journalism visualisation


---#10
Analyse data: be platform antagonistic. Some tools die because APIs change, others are abandoned by their developers, some are replaced by better alternatives.


---#11
Much like other types of reporting, journalism is something you can do at any stage of a story’s life. I’ll mention data releases in our next session. Sometimes, PR people will send data with an embargo.


---#12
Fastest growing names above ~200 Show how to download, clean up, filter, sort, visualise Difference between mean, median and mode. Mean, most basic type of average. Median, useful to account for outliers.


---#13
Show the original dataset first Some datasets (like the ONS one) come with a data dictionary. For Nicu: choose boys or girls based on if there are more women or men in the group


---#14



---#15
You can do video or even audio (data sonification), but bear in mind I won’t be able to help as much with any of the technical aspects of it. If you want to do non-text, contact me in advance.


---#16



---#17



---#18
Non-public data can come from press contacts Corporate data: uber movement (how we’re using it for low-traffic neighbourhoods), google mobility


---#19
WhatDoTheyKnow Be as specific as possible or you might get the “too much work” excuse, specify the format or you’ll get a PDF Likelihood they’ll refuse (they refused my locations of CCTV cameras locations on national security grounds) If you want to use FOIs, do it as soon as possible.

Scraping (week 9) pre-scraped data like Inside Airbnb Parsehub , browser extensions, R/Python/Node

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TTEw6l94fJPebFFw2hlUTCjyozfHs2fOZSGCRH884E0/copy TASK: Which protest had the biggest number of participants? What about the highest since the year 2000? What about the lowest between 1990 and 2000? (pleas use sort and filter for these) 1) Concatenate title =CONCATENATE( A2 ,", ", B2 , " (", C2 ,")") 2) Conditional formatting on success column
